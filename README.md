#  H4X0R News ðŸ“° (I didn't choose the name btw)

## What is it about?
### H4X0R News is an app that shows the front page news from [Hacker News Website](https://news.ycombinator.com), and when you click on it, you'll be redirected to the specific website which the news is from, all from inside the app.

## iPhone version

## It's just amazing how SwiftUI makes a lot of things easier. With Project Catalyst I didn't have to do anything to make the Mac Version of the app and it still looks fine.
### Anyway, here's what I've learned while working on it:

- Manage state using the @State property modifier.
- Learn about the @Published property modifier from the Combine framework that allows for more complex state management.
- Manage complex app state using the ObservableObject protocol.
- Learn to incorporate UIKit components in a SwiftUI app using the UIViewRepresentable protocol.
- See your iOS apps turn into a Mac app by leveraging project Catalyst.
- And last but not least, how to use Webkit :)

## This is a project from the iOS development bootcamp, taught by Angela Yu :)
